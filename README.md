# how to "hello world" on a nes/famicom
## code showing how to write hello world in a nes/famicom, with chr rom and chr ram.

i tried to explain in the best possible way in the comments of the codes, i hope it is understandable :3

i used the [CC65 compiler](https://cc65.github.io/) for this.
you can download it if you want to compile the code.

for emulation, i used the [Mesen emulator](https://www.mesen.ca/).

### links to websites that maybe help you understand the code:
  
i recommend you see the nesdev wiki to understand better. here are some more links:

a website that shows all [operations of the 6502 cpu](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html).
  
and some fun simulations of the [MOS6502](https://floooh.github.io/visual6502remix/), [RP2A03](https://floooh.github.io/visual2a03remix/) and [RP2C02](https://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/visual2c02/) chips.
